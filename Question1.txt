1.let does not allow to redeclare variables. var allows to redeclare variables.
Example. 
var a = 5; // 5
var a = 3; //3
 
let a = 5;
let a = 3; // error 

2. let is block-scoped and var is function scoped. 
3. let Doesn't Allow Hoisting but  Hoisting occurs in var.
Example.
 console.log(a);
var a; // undefined (not an error)

console.log(a);
let a; // Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined
