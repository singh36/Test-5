Null:
Null means an empty or non-existent value. Null is assigned, and explicitly means nothing.
Example:
var test1 = null;
console.log(test1); // null

Undefined:

Undefined means a variable has been declared, but the value of that variable has not yet been defined. 
For example:
var test2;
console.log(test2); // undefined
Unlike null, undefined is of the type undefined:
console.log(typeof test2); // undefined

Not defined:
A not defined is a variable which is not declared at a given point of time with declaration keyword like var, 
let or const.
Example:
  console.log(a);
  var a = 5;
